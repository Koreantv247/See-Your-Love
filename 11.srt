00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,030
Zixiang?

7
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,030
Coming. Got it.

8
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,760
Ms. Zheng, why did you ask me out privately?

9
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,470
What would you like to drink?

10
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,240
I don't think we're close enough to drink coffee together.

11
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,180
When I first went to Hongcheng for a meeting,

12
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,310
I saw you being jealous because of a pen.

Your reaction that day was very interesting.

19
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,920
So I asked someone to investigate

20
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,360
your relationship with Jiang Shaopeng.

21
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,870
You two are a couple?

No.

23
00:03:58,770 --> 00:03:59,600
One-sided love doesn't count.

24
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,070
You have a crush on him?

25

If it's not about work, I should get going.

Why did you invite me to your celebration party?

It would be troublesome if he is.

Now this is more troublesome.

72

86
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,420
I'm not angry.

Yes.

96
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,910
You're jealous.

97
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,690
I'll forgive you if you admit it.

98
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,880
Jiang Shaopeng.

99
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,570
You're jealous.

Jiang Shaopeng...

101

Do you want to have a drink to celebrate?

102
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,780
Sure.

103
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,160
Do you think by doing this,

104
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:25,670
you can change their feelings for each other?

105
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,210
Shaopeng won't just give up because of what you did.

106
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,180
Why don't you think of a way?

107
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,460
Get pregnant?

108
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,960
What kind of way is that?

109
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,660
Learned it from palace intrigue dramas?

110
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,370
How did you know?

111
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,710
Miss, are you kidding me?

112
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,840
I have no other way.

113
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,160
I've never been in a relationship.

114
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,400
It's all because Zixiang wants to ruin the plan and break off the engagement.

115
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,140
Otherwise, I wouldn't need to be so worried.

116
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,070
So...

117
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,040
you don't like Yang Zixiang.

118
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,070
Do I have to?

119

Wait.

120
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,080
I drank alcohol.

121
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:38,200

122
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,290
I want to take a shower first.

00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,680
Wait.

Let me take a shower first.

125
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,800
I stink.

Wait, Jiang Shaopeng!

127
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,620

I'm indebted to him.

155

Of course I care about him.

Of course.

169

Let me make it clear first. My English isn't very good.

170
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,150
I type very slowly.

172
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:02,730
Don't worry.

173
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,240
I want you to do it because it suits you.

174
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:10,520
What's wrong?

175
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,520
Nothing.

176
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,200
He asked me to be his secretary,

177
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,800
but I'm doing manual labor.

178
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,700
His smile is so insincere.

179
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,120
What does it feel like to have

180
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,240
such a popular boss?

181
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,850
He's an elite coming back from America.

182
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,940
He's handsome and has a good personality.

183
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,260
Good personality?

184
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,970
His personality is terrible.

185
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:46,840
Hey.

186
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,310
Your perseverance is a thousand times better than your killing skills, isn't it?

187
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,300
He's very scheming.

188
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,290
And he's a playboy.

189
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,000
Handsome guy.

190
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:56,680
Handsome guy.

191
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,530
How about a drink with us?

192
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,840
Apart from his handsome appearance, there's

193
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,290
nothing else that makes him popular.

194
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,950
Special Assistant Cheng is that kind of person?

195
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,990
Of course.

196
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,270
Wang Xinjia.

197
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:08,450
What's the matter?

198
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,540
Black tea

199
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,300
with three slices of lemon,

200
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:12,610
no sugar.

201
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:13,750
Okay.

202
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,490
Three slices of lemon.

203
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,310
Are you pregnant?

204
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,700
It'd be yours.

205
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,820
I have excellent hearing.

206
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,140
Wang Xinjia!

207
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:48,980
Are you okay?

208
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,570
I'm fine.

209
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,780
Mom, stop trying to find me another boyfriend.

210
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:10,710
I will marry Yang Zixiang. I promise.

211
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,800
Your smartphone is innocent.

212
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:20,700
Taking your anger out on it won't do you any good, right?

213
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,260
I have plenty of money to buy a new one.

214
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,980
Is it your money or your family's money?

215
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:28,940
It's on me.

216
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,070
I hardly eat carbohydrates.

217
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,660
You're worried you'd gain weight?

218
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,240
Who's worried?

219
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,680
All my meals are designed by a nutritionist.

220
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,570
So obedient?

221
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,070
You even have a nutritionist for that?

222
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:47,520
You...

223
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,100
are quite cute.

224
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:49,930
What do you mean?

225
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,160
I heard what you just said on the phone.

226
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,340
If you can't marry Yang Zixiang,

227
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,160
your mother will find another man for you?

228
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,140
If I want to enjoy the wealth of my family,

229
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,210
I have to take on the responsibilities that come with it.

230
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,580
Marriage is just another form of contract.

231
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,810
Would you develop feelings for someone

232
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,740
you signed a contract with?

233
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,080
But marriage is built on love.

234
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,680
Why do people sign work contracts?

235
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:20,850
Sign work contracts?

236
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,290
To ensure mutual rights and obligations

237
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,960
to avoid unfair treatment or unnecessary losses.

238
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,610
You have a point.

239
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,100
So Yang Zixiang is a jerk.

240
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:43,980
Why are you suddenly jumping to that conclusion?

241
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,380
Why did he fall in love with someone?

242
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,220
He even displayed his affection in front of me.

243
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,700
He's a scumbag publicly having an affair.

244
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,100
I won't let him get away with it.

245
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,630
When you truly fall in love with someone, you'll understand.

246
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,480
Love isn't something you can control.

247
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,300
And marriage isn't just a contract.

248
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,300
It's also a promise that you'll love someone forever.

249
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,570
You've watched too many idol dramas, haven't you?

250
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,870
We agreed to work together to break them up.

251
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:12,910
Don't forget that.

252
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,860
Okay.

253
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,560
Is he the reason why you broke your promise?

254
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,130
Cousin, I'm sorry.

255
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,360
But don't worry.

256
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,700
I'll explain to my dad.

257
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,180
Explain what?

258
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,650
I've decided to stay in Taiwan.

259
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,520
Why?

260
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,510
I fell in love with someone.

261
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,980
I'll break off my engagement with Yunong

262
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,790
and stay with him in Taiwan.

263
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,630
Cousin, I'll leave Hengfeng to you.

264
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,950
You like Jiang Shaopeng?

265
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,990
You're off work?

266
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,520
Why are you crying?

267
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,730
Crying?

268
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,060
I'm not crying.

269
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,700
You don't have to tell me,

270
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,670
but don't lie to me.

271
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,270
Sign language can't tell lies.

272
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,390
I met my cousin today.

273
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,620
I fell in love with someone.

274
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,120
I'll break off my engagement with Yunong

275
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,970
and stay with him in Taiwan.

276
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,850
Cousin, I'll leave Hengfeng to you.

277
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,210
You like Jiang Shaopeng?

278
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,740
I shouldn't have

279
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,670
let you go in the sea back then.

280
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:40,850
Cousin.

281
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,650
Get lost.

282
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:49,680
You like your cousin very much?

283
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,330
He's awesome.

284
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:58,410
He's been determined to take over my family's business since childhood.

285
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,000
He's different from me.

286
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,150
When I was a child, I fell into the sea

287
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,300
and almost got him drowned.

288
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,430
Perhaps because of that,

289
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,540
plus my father's wish for me to take over the family business,

290
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,140
things have become awkward between us.

291
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,890
Sometimes,

292
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,400
he's nice to me.

293
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,000
Sometimes, he's cold.

294
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,260
My family

295
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,050
value interests more than family bonds.

296
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,140
You know what?

297
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,160
I quite like the atmosphere in your family.

298
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,770
Your parents care about you.

299
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,180
You care about them too.

300
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:41,770
You can even joke with each other.

301
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,070
It makes me feel

302
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,740
warm and happy.

303
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,740
My family

304
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:07,870
are also

305
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,250
yours.

306
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:32,520
Do you know what you just said means?

307
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,700
You're going back to America?

308
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,570
If you really love Shaopeng,

309
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,440
please leave him.
