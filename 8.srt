to kill Yang Zixiang, trying to

00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,610
make a name for yourself and climb the ranks.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,690
You're annoying.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,650

20
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,630
I didn't like him.

21
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,000
But he couldn't understand.

22

00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,980
It's no fun. How could you tell it was me?

52
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,920
Only you would pull stunts like this.

53
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,800
Did you argue with your boss again?

54
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,760
Work's finally over, and he arranged for me

55
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,159
to go interview at Xin'an Long-term Care Center.

56
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,100
Well,

57
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,090
he's a good guy, then.

58
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,080
He's a man of his word.

59
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,110
Yes.

What?

64
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,060
I called you several times.

65
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,800
What are you spacing out for?

66
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,670
Just eat your food properly.

67
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,880
You barely had a couple of bites, and now you're zoning out.

68
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,210
You think my cooking's bad?

69
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,280
It's edible.

70
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,560
How can you even say that?

71
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,140
I put a lot of effort into it.

72
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,280
I can tell.

73
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,230
You're way better with a knife than with a butterfly knife.

74
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,380
Don't think I can't tell you're making fun of me.

75
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,120
It's only been a few days since Jiang Shaopeng left. But you're like this.

00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,820
Do you like me too?

80
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,310
I'll go check.

81
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,060
Hello?

82
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,670
You've arranged everything with Xin'an Long-term Care Center?

83
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,700
Yes.

84
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,780
You still haven't answered my question.

85
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,000
What happened between you and Jiang Shaopeng?

86
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,730
I'll leave the person who tried to kill me in secret to you.

87
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,520
Why?

88
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,030
I'm so weak.

89
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,110
I can barely protect myself.

90
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,840
Why would I step up?

91
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,790
Protecting the boss is your job, right?

92
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,220
Who admits to being weak?

93
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,340
You let Jiang Shaopeng leave to protect him?

94
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,230
No wonder you keep urging me to catch him early.

95
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,800
Some things, it's better not to say outright.

96
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,380
Still pretending?

97
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,180
Can you guys speak normal words?

98
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,440
I don't understand any of this.

99
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,270
Be good.

100
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,200
When you're under someone's roof, don't ask too many questions.

101
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,350
Fine.

102
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,380
I'll get a part-time job.

103
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,920
When I save enough money

104
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,320
to rent a place, I'll leave.

105
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,480
What?

106
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,150
Nothing good happens when you look at me like this.

107
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,350
You're overthinking it.

108
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,680
Puppy.

109
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,780
Don't touch me.

110
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,300
Xinjia and I will handle the one who attacked us.

111
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,530
This person will be your responsibility.

112
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,570
What?

113
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,150
Which one?

114
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:06,950
Who?

115
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,410
Who?

116
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,280
Honey.

117
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,770
Jessica.

118
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,600
You...

119
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,230
Why are you here?

120
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,250
I missed you.

121
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,650
It's just a joint investment mall project,

122
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,670
and it's been dragging on for so long.

123
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,410
Your dad's really mad,

124
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,780
so he asked me to come help.

125
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:41,970
What?

126
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,470
Don't you welcome me?

127
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,720
No.

128
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,900
You came just in time.

129
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,300
We were going to talk about this anyway.

130
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,900
About what?

131
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,830
President, I heard that you sent Zheng Yunong to Taiwan to find Zixiang.

132
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,060
The progress in Taiwan has been too slow.

133
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,780
Plus, they are engaged.

134
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,110
Being apart for too long isn't good either.

135
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,470
Let's see if working on the same thing

136
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,530
will make their relationship better.

137
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,670
A family like us needs affection?

138
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,020
Affection is the minimum connection we need.

139
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,980
Family interests always come first.

140
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,450
I heard you've been getting close to Mr. Sun's granddaughter lately.

141
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,360
Yes.

142
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,370
For the family's benefit.

143
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,190
Funny.

144
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,450
Why did you pull me out here?

145
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,410
To avoid that beautiful woman?

146
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,510
What's her relationship with Yang Zixiang?

147
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,460
She walked in and immediately asked him to pour her tea.

148
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,070
Do you think she's pretty?

149
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,090
I think she's alright.

150
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,130
Prettier than me?

151
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,680
Are you crazy?

152
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,840
What are you even competing about this with a woman?

153
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,590
Say it again.

154
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,960
I have someone I like.

155
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,990
You promised when you asked me to get engaged

156
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,500
that as long as I liked someone...

157
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,630
What if I regret it?

158
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,810
Why are you glaring at me?

159
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:28,600
Showing off your big eyes?

160
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,630
My eyes aren't any smaller.

161
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,990
Yang Zixiang.

162
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,530
You can't do this to me.

163
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,640
You know

164
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,910
that without marriage,

165
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,920
I can't get rid of my parents' control

166
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,480
nor access my assets.

167
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,030
Let's just get married.

168
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,600
After we marry, you can do whatever you want.

169
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,730
I won't control you.

170
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,590
I swear

171
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,200
I can help you get what you want,

172
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,760
as long as you're willing to call off the engagement.

173
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,020
Are you serious?

174
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,930
Why go this far?

175
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:05,940
You know,

176
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,040
without using marriage, our paths will be difficult.

177
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,150
If he really likes you,

178
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,270
tell him about this.

179
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,300
He'll endure for you.

180
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,030
I don't know if he likes me.

181
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,640
Even if he does,

182
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,550
it's not a reason to ask him to endure for me.

183
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,740
The person I like

184
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,360
has always been working hard to overcome his difficulties,

185
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,150
chasing after his goals.

187
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,200
Mr. Jiang?

188
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,000
Hello.

189
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,790
Hello.

190
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,620
I'm the director of Xin'an.

191
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,250
Welcome to our team of caregivers at Xin'an.

192
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,180
We've recently received a few patients who are deaf,

193
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,660
and we're looking for caregivers who understand them

194
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,970
and have professional backgrounds.

195
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,630
Even if others doubt him,

196
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,020
saying it's impossible,

197
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,330
mock him,

198
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,390
and tell him he's dreaming,

199
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,920
he didn't give up.

200
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,320
This way, please.

201
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,960
He seizes every opportunity for an interview

202
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,670
and does his best in what he wants to do.

203
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,990
So, I'm ashamed of myself

204
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,800
for being aimless and beating myself up.

205
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,360
Compared to him,

206
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,480
our troubles now seem

207
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,700
so indulgent.

208
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,290
To solve problems like this,

209
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,950
it feels pathetic.

210
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,690
You really like him,

211
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,820
don't you?

212
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,430
When I realized it, I already liked him a lot.

213
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,560
You're so honest.

214
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,540
What should I do?

215
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,770
What are you trying to tell me?

216
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,000
Find the person who wants to kill you with me.

217
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,360
What?

218
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,180
Scared?

219
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,200
Who's scared?

220
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,880
He beat me up so badly.

221
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,330
If I don't teach him a lesson,

222
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,660
I'd better change my name.

223
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:16,570
Do you realize

224
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,000
this means you're going against Crazy Dog Dong?

225
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,350
Trying to leave the gang?

226
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,850
I actually wasn't

227
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,750
even fully in the gang.

228
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,540
I made Brother Dong my boss...

229
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,840
Without joining the gang, what's there to kill?

230
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,550
I just thought if I could achieve something,

231
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,080
I could become Brother Dong's right-hand man,

232
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,620
with my own turf to manage.

233
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,200
I guess I was too simple-minded.

234
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,290
You're right.

235
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,510
I'm not cut out for this.

236
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,750
But I have to settle the score for the beating.

237
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,390
How do you want to catch him?

238
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,140
I'll help you.

239
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,920
I'm not a dog.

240
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,700
You.

241
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,770
You're a husky.

242
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,790
What is that?

243
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,250
What husky?

244
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,220
Who is the person Zixiang likes?

245
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,340
Where does he live?

246
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:40,590
Little Boss doesn't have anyone he likes.

247
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,550
Zixiang told me himself.

248
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,730
You haven't worked for him for long, right?

249
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,070
And you already want to help him?

250
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,940
I only found out because you said so.

251
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,090
Cut the crap.

252
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,740
I don't have patience.

253
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,180
I can find out even if you don't tell me.

254
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,270
But what I'll do to that person after…

255
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,370
Who knows?

256
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,460
I have a terrible temper.

257
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,120
Water.

258
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,270
Wait. I'll get it.

259
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,130
Thank you for taking care of my fiancé.

260
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,650
How's work?

261
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,660
What happened to make you upset?

262
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,100
What's wrong with you?

263
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,720
My fiancé.

264
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,170
Why are you acting like this?

265
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,250
Is it because I said I like you?

266
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,300
If you don't like me, you can just reject me.

267
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,310
We can keep being friends.

268
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:45,380
Why act like this?

269
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,840
You have a fiancée but still say you like me.

270
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,030
What's that about?

271
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,300
How do you know?

272
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,440
Let me explain.

274

Yes.

Are you here to see Shaopeng again?

278
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,450
Where is Shaopeng?

279
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,370
Why didn't you greet your guest but hid in your room instead?

280
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,350
I'm sorry. Auntie.

281
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,200
It's all my fault.

282
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,880
He's angry.

283

I haven't seen him angry for a long time.

284

All this time,

285
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:24,070
he only lets us see him smile,

286
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,550
never letting us worry.

287
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,820
No matter what we did,

288
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,630
he'd rather hide everything

289
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,350
than let us share his negative feelings.

290
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,390
Seeing him angry,

291
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,090
I feel so happy.
