We had only been together for a month when you proposed to me.

If you are too anxious,

190
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,230
you might make a wrong choice.

191

You didn't say anything about our son's matter.

203

I was about to say something just now.

204

I said ten sentences, but you only said one sentence.

205

What should you do without me?

206
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,000
Thank you, Honey.

207

You're lucky to have me as your wife.

This.

00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,430
I've roughly introduced the environment.

Using crutches looks really ugly.

226
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,320
Sitting in a wheelchair is convenient and commanding.
