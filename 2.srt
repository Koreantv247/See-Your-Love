[Episode 2]

3
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,460
What took them so long?

4
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,100
Yes.

5
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,000
Finally.

6
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,280
Welcome to my...

7
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,630
Wait, it's you?

8
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,940
My clothes.

9
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,260
My face.

10
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,480
There's nothing on my face, right?

11
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,940
Nothing on my face, right?

12
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,829
What are you doing?

13
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,680
Do me a favor.

14
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:53,940
Over there.

15
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,980
Put me here.

16
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,030
I'll lend you my other bathroom.

17
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,320
Wait! Help me get my clothes.

18
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,390
I didn't do it on purpose.

19
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,079
Why is he so angry?

20
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,970
I asked him to grab my clothes, and he pretended not to hear.

21
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,329
So annoying!

22
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,360
Jonathan, I hate you!

23
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,700
Come here.

24
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,970
Come here.

25
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,020
Come here.

26
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,810
Nice figure.

27
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,590
Do you work out?

28
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,610
Didn't know you get packs.

29
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,160
[Do you have a dryer at home?]

30
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:31,700
What's with you?

31
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,440
Too mad to talk now?

32
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,610
So petty.

33
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,080
I've made it up to you.

34
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,070
I lent you my bathroom.

35
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,430
And now you want a dryer?

36
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,909
[I can't hear or speak, so I don't understand what you're saying]

37
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,580
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

38
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,380
I've been rambling on this whole time!

39
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,850
What am I, a stand-up comedian?

40
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,140
[I can't hear or speak, so I don't understand what you're saying]

41
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,100
So how are we supposed to communicate?

42
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:02,850
Right.

43
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,420
Use voice input.

44
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,520
As long as we can communicate, it's fine.

45
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,180
Could you do me one more favor?

46
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,500
Wash my clothes together with yours.

47
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,100
Come on.

48
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,060
I just need to use the washing machine.

49
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,990
It's not like you have to hand wash.

50
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,320
How about another little favor?

51
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,860
This is my dryer.

52
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,420
Seriously, you won't help?

53
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,120
Fine, whatever.

54
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,950
Fine.

55
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,500
I'll just wash them myself.

56
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,290
Didn't even let me finish before saying no.

57
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,040
This is my place.

58
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,440
Whose shoes are these outside?

59
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,760
Who did you let in?

60
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,360
You didn't cook for me,

61
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,409
got mad, and stormed out.

62
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:53,370
So I had to order takeout.

63
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,050
You said you wouldn't cook, but then you bought me food.

64
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,520
Jonathan, you're pretty nice after all.

65
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,290
Ordering takeout and letting strangers in.

66
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,040
Have you forgotten why we're staying here?

67
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,850
Of course not.

68
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,660
Getting chased down for no reason.

69
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,290
Could it be the mob?

70
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,480
Who is he?

71
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,440
He's just the delivery guy.

72
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,780
I heard the gangs get involved

73
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,040
with the land development here.

74
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,880
Rigging bids, fighting over contracts,

75
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,480
even murder and arson.

76
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,550
Gangs.

77
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,179
Murder and arson.

78
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,320
What exactly did you order?

79
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,290
What are you doing?

80
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,570
There's someone else here.

81
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,560
Watch what you say.

82
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,960
Relax, he can't hear us.

83
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,920
He doesn't know what we're saying.

84
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,680
Just in case.

85
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,300
Have you looked into their backgrounds?

86
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,430
Still working on it.

87
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,390
Take your time.

88
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,570
Bye.

89
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,250
I'll order again so you can deliver it next time.

90
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,140
Told you he couldn't hear, and you still didn't believe it.

91
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,560
Didn't you say crutches look lame?

92
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:28,800
The wheelchair's broken.

93
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,400
I'm waiting for you to fix it.

94
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,340
Jonathan,

95
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,400
help me fix the wheelchair.

96
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:46,320
Don't worry, President.

97
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,920
The young boss's injury has been taken care of.

98
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,160
His performance?

99
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,190
Very good.

100
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,860
Even though he's injured, he's still working hard.

101
00:09:59,230 --> 00:09:59,930
Yes.

102
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,430
I will take good care of him

103
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,030
and help him close this deal.

104
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,990
You've worked hard.

105
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,890
Lying to my dad isn't easy, huh?

106
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,010
How do you expect your father

107
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,460
to trust Hengfeng Group to you?

108
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,430
Whoever wants it can have it.

109
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,760
I don't want it anyway.

110
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,060
All I want is to live off my dividends.

111
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,250
Do you know what people say about you behind your back?

112
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,310
Useless rich kid.

113
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,150
Yep, I'm really useless.

114
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,440
So I suggest you switch bosses.

115
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,270
You've got no future sticking with me,

116
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,290
wasting your amazing talent.

117
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,900
Do you even have any shame left?

118
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,350
From now on,

119
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,800
why don't you be Yang Zixiang?

120
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
I'll stay here and rest up.

121
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,770
My leg really hurts.

122
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,110
How is it?

123
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,950
Can you get any more useless?

124
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,640
I...

125
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,260
I'll try harder then.

126
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,650
Jonathan.

127
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,360
I'm thirsty. I want some water.

128
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,860
Get me some water.

129
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,750
Jonathan!

130

[Jiang Shaopeng]

132
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,270
Do me a favor.

133
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,870
I knew you'd make it in time.

134
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,310
Thank you!

135
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,140
Oh.

136
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,990
Without this document,

137
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,390
today's meeting would've been a disaster.

138
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,240
You're going to an interview?

139
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,310
I hope I didn't make you late.

140
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:32,840
It's fine.

141
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,770
It's close,

142
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,910
just downstairs.

143
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,270
Good luck.

144
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:40,130
I'll wait for your good news.

145
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,270
You're smiling so brightly.

146
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,550
Was it your boyfriend?

147
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,400
The department heads are already

148
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,020
waiting in the meeting room.

149
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,230
You have a beautiful smile.

150
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,830
You should smile more often.

151
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,270
One more thing about my smile,

152
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,500
I'll sue you for workplace harassment.

153
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,230
Ms. Song,

154
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,080
shall we start the meeting?

155
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,010
Jonathan,

156
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,820
let's go to the meeting room.

157
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,140
Hurry.

158
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:27,600
[We can't accept such a special employee]

159
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:27,600
[Our work requires immediate responsiveness]

160
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,630
Mr. Jiang.

161
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,360
Mr. Jiang.

162
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,430
Mr. Jiang.

163
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,440
Your documents.

164
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,350
Sorry.

165
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,440
What our manager just said

166
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,210
may have sounded harsh.

167
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,440
Please don't take it personally.

168
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,770
Your written test scores were great,

169
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,750
but…

170
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,740
Since you can't hear,

171
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,260
it's a bit…

172
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,380
Hold on a second.

173
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,140
Wait.

174
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,050
