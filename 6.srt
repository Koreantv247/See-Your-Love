[Why don't you want to take over your dad's business?]

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,980
[My mom passed away...]

3
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,630
My mom passed away when I was very young.

4
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,360
Ever since I can remember,

5
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,290
my life has been measured by the hour.

6
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,440
5 a.m. get up.

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,570
6 a.m. breakfast.

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,290
7 a.m. head to school.

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,830
8 a.m. exams.

10
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,430
My childhood was nothing

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,400
but sleeping, studying,

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,350
exams,

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,680
and reporting my grades to my dad.

14
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,370
He'd always listen to me while working.

15
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,710
You are not the same.

16
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,280
When you listen to me,

17
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,360
it's like it's the most important thing in the world.

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,450
[Freedom]

19
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,170
I want freedom.

20
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,510
I was like a pawn

21
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,280
on his chessboard, moved wherever he wanted.

22
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,450
Even when it comes to love,

23
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,330
I can only passively resist.

24
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:50,910
What is this?

25
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:01,020
[Your name, Yang Zixiang]

26
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,560

[Xiang means to fly]

28
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,210
[You'll definitely get the freedom you want]

29

How to sign freedom?

30
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,780
What is this?

31
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,470
Dreams come true.

32
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,160
Dream?

33
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,630
Yang Zixiang.

34
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,870
Dream.

35
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,030
[See Your Love]

36
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:25,690
[Episode 6]

37
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,830
Dreams come true.

38
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:46,430
Fly.

39
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:56,510
[To color or not to color]

40
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,510
Yeah, we meet again.

41
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,890
Yes.

42
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,150
We meet again.

43
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:13,320
Buy me a drink?

44
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,770
So, are you mine tonight?

45
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,800
Sorry.

46
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,430
Tonight I just want to drink.

47
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,160
But I'm going abroad tomorrow.

48
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,670
Safe travels.

49
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,770
Buzzkill.

50
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,560
Next time, don't say no.

51
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,010
He hasn't shown up these past few days.

52
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,120
Being too clever can be a problem.

53
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,320
I'm just good at observing.

54
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,590
Was there something unforgettable

55
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,860
between you two that night?

56
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,100
Some things lose their fun once you say them out loud.

57
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:40,850
So,

58
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,260
what's the game today?

59
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,070
Hey.

60
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,710
Your perseverance is a thousand times better than your killing skills, isn't it?

61
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,880
Yang Zixiang, you bastard!

62
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,410
If you're a real man, let's fight one-on-one.

63
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,620
Only if you can beat me.

64
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,150
Otherwise, whether I let you go ten times or not, it's the same.

65
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,340
Ten times?

66
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,300
Try letting me go,

67
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,190
then see if you can beat me or not.

68
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,200
Coward!

69
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,460
Let go!

70
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,159
That guy was here last time too.

71
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,040
Who the hell is he?

72
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,760
Hello?

73
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,830
Brother Dong.

74
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,700
About Yang Zixiang,

75
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,200
did you only assign it to me,

76
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,700
or are you playing both sides

77
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,930
and hired someone else?

78
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,260
Since I signed it to you,

79
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,120
how could I have found someone else?

80
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,460
If the job's not done,

81
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,900
that's on you.

82
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,660
Are you trying to blame others?

83
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,200
I won't fail.

84
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,830
Bastard!

85
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,780
Fang Wenqing!

86
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:37,909
I'm telling you...

87
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:39,090
How's it going?

88
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,440
Mr. Yang.

89
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,260
Why did you call me in person?

90
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,230
Answer me.

91
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,030
If you tell me where Yang Zixiang is,

92
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:51,950
we'll get it done sooner.

93
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,610
If I knew, why would I hire you?

94
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,550
I know. I know.

95
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,970
Rest assured.

96
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,430
I won't disappoint you.

97
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,440
So arrogant.

98
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,050
So what if you're rich?

99
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,240
Let go of me, you jerk!

100
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,080
Déjà vu, huh?

101
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,390
Remember our first time?

102
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,080
Who had a first time with you?

103
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,860
And tonight, we'll have our second time.

104
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,950
But this time,

105
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,610
I'm in charge.

106
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,230
No way!

107
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,990
I'll stab you if you move again.

108
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,980
Who sent you?

109
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,760
Then...

110
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,820
How dare you tie me up?

111
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,840
Now it's my turn.

112
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,780
If I succeed,

113
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,140
I can be the gang leader.

114
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,870
You couldn't even kill a cockroach.

115
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,800
But you think you can kill someone?

116
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,230
Killing someone is no big deal—

117
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,670
why am I trembling?

118
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,050
Fine, I'll let you go for now

119
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,900
so you can't say I'm unfair.

120
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,440
You owe me this.

121
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,470
That hitman is kind of cute.

122
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,100
Calling that a hitman?

123
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,670
I wonder who sent him.

124
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,550
Their judgment is terrible.

125
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,810
Two assassination attempts,

126
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,150
but the difference in skill is huge.

127
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,720
Could it be a trick?

128
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,550
Make you drop your guard, then strike when you least expect it?

129
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,120
Make me drop my guard?

130
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,760
They're targeting you.

131
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,770
You're the Yang Zixiang

132
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,790
who's always running around out there—not me.

133
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,720
Do you think...

134
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,780
Why are you here?

135
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,790
You two know each other?

136
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,120
Wait.

137
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,680
It seems that they know each other.

138
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,160
So, the person you've been looking after is Yang Zixiang?

139
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,150
The useless rich kid.

140
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:49,720
The useless guy you mentioned before is him?

141
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,630
Yes.

142
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,060
It was him.

143
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:53,660
He pretended to be hurt

144
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,740
to dump all his work on his assistant.

145
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,040
[My dad wants me to take over the family business, but I don't want to]

146
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,630
[I'm so useless, aren't I?]

147
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,740
He has his own thoughts.

148
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,830
Even if he does,

149
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,390
it's not right to become a burden on others.

150
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,320
How strange…

151
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,680
Don't be angry.

152
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,380
Anger makes you age faster.

153
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,060
Me, age?

154
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,680
Where?

155
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,530
Where?

156
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,840
Tell me where.

157
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,020
Tell me.

158
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,820
You're cute.

159
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:26,790
Say it again.

160
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,570
You're cute.

161
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,480
Alright, alright.

162
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,920
So what if you know sign language?

163
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,840
You.

164
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,210
We.

165
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,470
Please.

166
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,240
Thank you.

167
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,680
Sorry.

168
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,180
You two.

169
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,140
Both of us.

170
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:24,910
Please.

171
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,260
Thank you.

172
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,610
Sorry.

173
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,460
Fitness.

174
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,700
Biceps.

175
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,520
I work hard, and it's exhausting.

176
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,620
So let's keep it up.

177
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,020
Keep it up.

178
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,890
Sorry.

179
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,980
Hula hoop?

180
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,890
Mouth?

181
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,580
Blow out the candles?

182
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,360
Very happy.

183
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:23,550
Cake.

184
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,280
Very happy.

185
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,400
Birthday celebration?

186
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,440
Birthday!

187
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,330
Have some fruit.

188
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,480
Fruit?

189
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,890
Fruit.

190
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,480
Okay.

191
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,950
Thank you.

192
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,400
Tastes good.

193
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,680
If there are snacks…

194
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,790
They're still baking.

195
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,930
Just wait a little longer.

196
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,190
They're still baking.

197
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,270
You're learning sign language so quickly.

198
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,170
Of course.

199
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,570
I'm good at languages.

200
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,050
Sign language is just another one—

201
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,870
it's your language.

202
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,700
Did I say something wrong?

203
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,970
No, you're right.

204
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,810
Sign language is our language.

205
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,980
What's wrong?

206
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,250
Nothing.

207
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,870
My back is a bit sore.

208
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,720
You're still sleeping in the closet?

209
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,540
How did you know?

210
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,900
It's not good for your back

211
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,730
to sleep that way.

212
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,170
Why do you sleep in there?

213
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,190
It's the only way I can fall asleep.

214
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:11,730
When I was little, I often hid in the closet.

215
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,290
Inside,

216
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,430
I could do whatever I wanted.

217
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,940
It was my only little world.

218
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,590
I could ride my little boat

219
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,260
and go

220
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,680
wherever I wanted.

221
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,220
My dad couldn't control me there.

222
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,520
[Freedom]

223
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,400
Why that face?

224
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,390
I'm going to check on the snacks.

225
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,160
Okay.

226
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,960
Numbers are off.

227
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,240
For this plot of land,

228
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,420
we also need to include this irregular piece on the side.

229
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,640
The building coverage ratio is 80%,

230
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,330
and the floor area ratio is 350%.

231
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,610
Converted,

232
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,930
that's about 29,723 pings for the building area.

233
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,080
The calculations are off.

234
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,830
Sorry.

235
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,470
Your leg's healed.

236
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
You can come back to work now, right?

237
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:26,550
Still…

238
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,520
Still need rest?

239
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:30,240
The land auction is almost over, you know.

240
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:31,850
Or…

241
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,140
I could ask President Yang to return

242
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,540
and take charge himself.

243
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,420
Focus on the meeting.

244
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,260
The bidding day is coming up.

245
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:44,960
Hurry up.

246
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:45,620
Ken.

247
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,530
Where were we?

248
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,780
Here,

249
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,880
The most vicious is a woman's heart.

250
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:11,060
I'm going back to work next Monday.

251
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,290
Have you figured out a way to face your family?

252
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,500
How did you know?

253
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,740
If you don't want to go back to work,

254
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,000
you'll definitely find a way to avoid it.

255
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,970
You know me too well.

256
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,670
I actually need to thank you.

257
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:28,910
Me?

258
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,030
Have you ever resented the fact that you can't hear?

259
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,080
It's okay if you don't want to answer.

260
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,340
I don't know.

261
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,040
I've lost my hearing for so long

262
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,950
that I don't have any memories of sound.

263
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,210
Never had it,

264
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,280
so there's no sense of loss.

265
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,700
There's nothing to resent.

266
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,970
I just think about how to live

267
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,560
and how to handle things.

268
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,740
That's exactly why.

269
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,740
If you can face it,

270
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,660
how can I keep running away?

271
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,620
It's too shameful.

272
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,850
What's making you so happy?

273
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,150
I don't need to wait for someone to kill me;

274
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,820
I'll just finish you first.

275
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,180
You and Song Shuhe are close.

276
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,080
You like her?
