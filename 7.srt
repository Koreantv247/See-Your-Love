175
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,200
How did you know Brother Dong is my boss?

176
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,200
You really are slow-witted.

177
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,550
You were chased

178
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,110
because Crazy Dog Dong thinks you're in his way.

179
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,700
Wang Xinjia,

180
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,530
you've been abandoned.

181
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:38,750
Impossible!

182
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,620
Boss won't abandon me.

183
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:41,590
It must be...

184
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,240
Continue to lie to yourself!

185
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,640
You're too naive.

186
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:46,700
You're not suited to being a gangster.

187
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,120
Don't try to harm Yang Zixiang.

188
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,620
Otherwise,

189
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,980
even if they won't kill you,

190
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,390
I'll kill you first.

191
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,310
Live here for the time being.

192
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,849
Calm down and think about it.

193
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,300
No.

194
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,510
Boss won't treat me like this.

195
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,270
Cheng Fengjie.

196
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,109
Jiang Shaopeng.

197
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,430
Jiang Shaopeng.

198
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,110
I'm going to take these inside.

199
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,000
Okay.

200
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,380
If it's just for fun,

201
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,580
I won't care.

202
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,730
Anyway, we'll go back once we secure the land bidding project.

203
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,520
If you're serious,

204
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,910
I advise you to give up.

205
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,450
President and your fiancée

206
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,390
are not easy to deal with.

207
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,020
You know clearly what will happen.

208
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:45,710
Life is about a series of choices.

209
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,490
No one can be an exception,

210
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,090
not even you.

211
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,970
Has the Legal Affairs Office prepared the contract?

212
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,970
Send it to me within three days.

213
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,230
Otherwise,

214
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,770
I'll go there myself.

215
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:22,190
What's wrong with him?

216
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,530
Is he crazy?

217
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,500
He's been like this since he entered the company in the morning.

218
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,820
The lion pretending to sleep is finally willing to wake up.

219
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,710
I have something to tell you.

220
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:31,630
Come with me.

221
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,550
We're back.

222
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,510
Perfect timing. The meal is ready.

223
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,150
Hi.

224
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,280
Can I join you?

225
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,990
I thought you came here for Wang Xinjia.

226
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,320
Yes.

227
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,890
Where is Wang Xinjia?

228
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,660
Where is Wang Xinjia?

229
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,410
Upstairs.

230
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,980
It's a hearty meal.

231
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,270
Is your work tiring?

232
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:24,620
I'll get back to work first.

233
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,150
Let me help you.

234
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,560
Song Shuhe!

235
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,160
I think there's something wrong with the bid price.

236
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,780
Come and discuss with me.

237
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,710
Okay.

238
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,030
I'm going to work first.

239
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,260
I'll come to help you later.

240
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,540
Hurry up.

241
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:53,960
What's wrong?

242
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,760
I thought you'd run away.

243
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,570
I didn't expect you to stay here.

244
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,430
Wang Xinjia.

245
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:14,900
What's wrong?

246
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,030
I just drank milk

247
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,750
and had diarrhoea.

248
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,270
I really shouldn't have drunk it.

249
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,980
Why did you drink it since you knew you'd have diarrhoea?

250
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,880
Who asked you to drink it?

251
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:28,600
Jiang Shaopeng?

252
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,260
I wanted to drink it.

253
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,340
He bought clothes for me and cooked for me.

254
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,000
He poured milk for me kindly.

255
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,170
How could I refuse

256
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,230
and let him down?

257
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,210
No one had ever cared about me like that before.

258
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,050
You're so honest,

259
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,440
yet you still want to be a gangster?

260
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:49,950
Be a good person.

261
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,610
Puppy.

262
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,930
Don't touch me.

263
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,720
Go downstairs for dinner.

264
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,160
You are so nice to me all of a sudden.

265
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,370
What's your ulterior motive?

266
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,300
You think Jiang Shaopeng is nice to you because he's kind.

267
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,260
But you think I'm nice to you because I have an ulterior motive?

268
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,180
Yes.

269
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,490
Do you want a beating?

270
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,350
Let go of me!

271
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,180
I can't hold it anymore!

272
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,220
Hold it in!

273
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,240
Not bad.

274
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,020
If Yang Zixiang fully recovers,

275
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,440
will your work be over?

276
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,010
When will you go home?

277
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,250
Although Auntie didn't tell me,

278
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,550
I know she misses you very much.

279
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,470
This is the first time you've been away from home for so long.

280
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,220
I know.

281
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,610
I will go home as soon as possible.

282
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,410
Tell me after you decide when to leave.

283
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,930
I'll come here to pick you up.

284
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,960
This woman actually...

285
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,020
What's wrong?

286
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,770
You and Song Shuhe are very close?

287
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:07,140
She just said she'd come here to pick you up.

288
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,570
We grew up together.

289
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,210
Your sign language has improved a lot.

290
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,450
You understood all of it.

291
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,920
I'm going out.

292
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,150
You like her?

293
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,860
When will you leave here?

294
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,050
You're so timid.

295
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,930
I guess...

296
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,490
you're just

297
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,340
a nobody around Crazy Dog Dong.

298
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,210
Are you sure you want to go?

299
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,170
I'll risk it.

300
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,000
I'll show the boss that I'm a real talent.

301
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,860
You came to cause trouble for Yang Zixiang yourself?

302
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,930
I like you.

303
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,590
Only I can kill...

304
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,760
You want to make contributions and get promoted?

305
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,880
If I can succeed,

306
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,870
I can become a branch leader.

307
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,060
You're so annoying!

308
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,750
Ghost!

309
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,480
Why are you doing this?

310
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,840
Because I said I like you that day?

311
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:05,930
Thank you for taking care of my... fiancé.
