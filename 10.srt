How about it?

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,460
It was quite a diversion, right?

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,430
Not bad.

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,510
Are you sure you'll win the bid?

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,370
Of course.

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,940
I rarely get serious,

7
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,340
so I have to secure this.

8
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,250
Otherwise, how can I face Jiang Shaopeng?

9
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,780
What does Jiang Shaopeng have to do with this?

10

That's a secret.

not complete the task you entrusted to me?

16
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,990
Then why am I hearing that the bidding has already been submitted?

17
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:40,890
How is that possible?

18
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:41,990
Mr. Yang, I...

19
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,100

That's the president's arrangement.

His life, even his feelings,

he ended your job early

44
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,180
He likes you, wants to be with you,

and doesn't want you to think he's useless.

46
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,690
He's been working hard to prove himself,

even preparing to confront the president for you.

48

He's like a fool.

Don't give up.

103
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,120
It's not easy to meet someone you like.

And if they like you back,

105

You guys are too weak.

120
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,980
We're businessmen, not police.

121
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,660
Catching criminals is the police's job.

122
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,800
What a joke.

123
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,640
Little Boss always has such great luck.

124
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,810
Ridiculously good luck.

125
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,340
He's been like that since he was a kid.

126
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,370
Everyone else gets hurt, and he's always fine.

127
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,690
Luck is also an advantage.

128
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,420
Hey.

129
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,460
Which is better: being left on read, or not being read at all?

130
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,120
Obviously, not being read at all.

131
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,090
Being left on read means,

132
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,680
"I saw it but don't want to reply."

133
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,690
Not being read at all means, "I just don't want to deal with you."

134
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,900
What do you think?

135
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,880
Then Shaopeng...

136
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,080
What does this mean?

137
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,990
You're blatantly cheating on me in front of my face.

138
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,360
Impressive, Yang Zixiang.

139
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,090
Yeah.

140
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,130
I want you to know

141
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,220
how wonderful it feels to like someone.

142
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,930
Even if he leaves me on read,

143
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,390
even if it makes me anxious,

144
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,700
it still feels amazing.

145
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,670
If you understood that,

146
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,530
you wouldn't treat love and marriage so lightly

147
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,460
or use it as a tool to escape your family.

148
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,780
Our parents had marriages of convenience.

149
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,560
But that doesn't mean we have to follow their path.

150
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,390
A marriage without love...

151
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,350
Who says there's no love in my marriage?

152
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,810
I like you.

153
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,400
And I like you more every day.

154
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,200
He replied!

155
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,310
[It went well. She wants to have you over for dinner]

156
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,410
Make yourself at home.

157
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,940
Yang Zixiang!

158
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,110
I'm not in the mood.

159
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,920
Thank you.

160
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,250
Wow.

161
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,910
It's the seventh one today.

162
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,940
What's going on?

163
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,720
I'm not interested.

164
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,940
Everyone's reactions are so predictable.

165
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,810
Boring.

166
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,130
Not as fun as Wang Xinjia,

167
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,230
always full of surprises.

168
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,160
Why is he here?

169
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:40,260
Part-time job.

170
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,750
He's a great cook.

171
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,170
Stay with us for a bit.
