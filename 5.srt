Jiang Shaopeng, are you serious?

You don't want to join Xin'an Long-term Care Center?

Don't be like this! I'm sorry!

10
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,560
I worked very hard

11

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,350
Wait. Wait.

What did you do to make him so angry that he wants to resign?

166
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,310
Go buy salt for me.

168
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,790
Go. Go.

169
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,040
Buy salt.

174
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,850
I'll go buy salt with him.

175
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,400
I'll send him back later.

176
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,270
Okay.

177
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,760
Take your time.

178
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,310
I'm not in urgent need of it.

179
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,770
Take your time.

180
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,920
[I can't hear or speak]

181
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,920
[Don't worry. I won't tell Cheng Fengjie]

182
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,660
I do want you to keep it a secret,

183
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,990
but I came here mainly to apologize to you.

184
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,600
[I'm sorry that I used you]

185
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,280
I'm sorry that I used you.

186
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,380
No matter what the reason is,

187
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,730
I can't justify using you.

188
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,780
I'm sorry.

189
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,330
I hope you can accept my apology

190
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,080
and continue to take care of me.

191
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,460
Please.

192
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,780
[You drew them?]

193
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,490
Yes.

194
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:49,870
My...

195
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,570
interest.

196
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,550
[Why did you leave?]

197
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,270
Now, the whole family pays much attention

198
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,420
to your performance in Taiwan.

199
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,560
You can't handle it.

200
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,110
Do you know what people say about you behind your back?

201
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,040
Useless rich kid.

202
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,860
Um.

203
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,660
[Why did you leave?]

204
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,340
My dad wants me to take over the family business.

205
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,400
But I don't want to.

206
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,630
I want him to hand it over to my cousin.

207
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,100
He's very outstanding and capable.

208
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,110
But my dad doesn't like him.

209
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,090
[Why didn't you tell your dad?]

210
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,390
I dare not.

211
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:37,340
And he only wants to hear what he wants to hear.

212
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,400
I'm useless, right?

213
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,610
[You just love your dad very much and you don't want to let him down]

214
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,550
Continue to take care of me.

215
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,350
[Your leg has recovered]

216
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,660
I'm still injured.

217
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,900
Here.

218
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,520
Here.

219
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,750
And it hurts a lot here.

220
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,630
[I need to go home to get my luggage first]

221
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,770
That's all for today's meeting.

222
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,710
Ken, remind the department in charge to keep an eye on the progress.

223
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,350
Yes.

224
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,860
This is for you.

225
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,510
Thank you.

226
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,110
I hope you like today's tea.

227
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,080
It's great.

228
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,220
I like it very much.

229
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,950
[Meet me at 10:30 in Room 1213 at Ouyou Hotel]

230
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,940
Stay away from my subordinate.

231
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,480
He took the initiative.

232
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,280
That's it?

233
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,170
No punishment?

234
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,470
What I value is his competence.

235
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,710
Then you should change your attitude towards me.

236
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,490
I'm very competent.

237
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,800
Indeed, you're competent.

238
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,530
But my attitude towards you is purely personal.

239
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,860
It has nothing to do with your competence.

240
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,930
By the way,

241
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,680
has your Little Boss recovered?

242
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,590
He really wants you to pretend to be Yang Zixiang

243
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,990
and work on behalf of him?

244
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,430
You are doing this intentionally, aren't you?

245
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,130
You know I hate green peppers.

246
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,760
[You promised me you'd listen to me]

247
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,250
Half, okay?

248
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,660
Are we brothers?

249
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,640
You love to hold grudges.

250
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,920
[We'll be if you eat all of them]

251
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,840
You know what I was saying?

252
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,060
You can read lips?

253
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,120
Then why did you use your smartphone?

254
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,880
My dad wants me to take over the family business.

255
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,220
[I dare not, and he only wants to hear what he wants to hear]

256
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,940
[Life is a schedule measured in hours]

257
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,940
[My mom passed away a long time ago. Since I started to remember things...]

258
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:39,980
[It was hard to read your lips. But I'm used to it now. I can understand most of it]

259
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:39,980
[We weren't close back then, so I couldn't understand the way your mouth moves when you speak]

260
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,530
When I talked about the job with you back then,

261
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,840
what I told Jonathan...

262
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,440
what I told Cheng Fengjie...

263
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,160
You're worried the person hired would be a leaker.

264
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,090
It's perfect that he can't hear us.

265
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,770
We'll be brothers after I eat all of them.

266
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,410
Can we be friends and brothers now?

267
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,860
Do you think I'm a kid?

268
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,850
Have you found the people who tried to assassinate Yang Zixiang?

269
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,250
Keep looking.

270
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,440
I'll pay attention to it in Taiwan.

271
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,540
Give the knife back to me!

272
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,380
You again.

273
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,660
It was your first time killing someone, right?

274
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,630
You didn't even know how to choose the right time or place to do it.

275
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,160
It's none of your business!

276
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,580
Remember, don't make a sound when you attack from behind

277
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,480
to avoid being noticed by your target.

278
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,680
What you are doing now is really stupid.

279
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,590
Shut up!

280
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,200
But it's much better

281
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,600
than your sex skills.

282
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,040
Bastard!

283
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,560
I won't let you go.

284
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,170
I'll definitely outshine you!

285
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,840
In which aspect?

286
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,410
He's like an idiot.

Brother Dong.

289
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,590
I've found Yang Zixiang's special assistant.

290
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,580
I'll continue to follow him

291
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,840
and find Yang Zixiang.

292
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,020
Who sent you here?

293
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,610
Have you ever complained that you can't hear?
