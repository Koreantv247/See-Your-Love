[Episode 3]

3
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,120
Good morning.

4
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,770
Did he slam the door in my face?

5
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,950
Yes.

6
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,920
[I don't want to be your caretaker]

7
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,200
I was refused.

8
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:44,970
Yes.

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,009
You were refused.

10
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,039
[I don't want to be your caretaker]

11
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,500
Forget it if he's not willing.

12
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,130
No, I need a caretaker.

13
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,509
You're worried the person hired would be a leaker.

14
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,229
He's deaf.

15
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,070
It's perfect.

16
00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:00,840
No one would hire a deaf man to be a business spy.

17
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,910
I want him.

18
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,560
I have nothing else

19
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,180
except a lot of money.

20
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,040
I can offer you a fat salary and free room and board,

21
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,170
as long as you agree to be my caretaker.

22
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,130
[No]

23
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,390
Are you not satisfied with the job or me?

24
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,079
You win.

25
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,600
How about this?

26
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,290
If you agree to be my caretaker,

27
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,490
I'll recommend you to Xin'an Long-term Care Center after it's done.

28
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,640
You marked it with five stars on the memo.

29
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,770
You want to work there the most, right?

30
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,690
I have a way.

31
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,140
Besides a lot of money, I have many friends.

32
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:54,900
What do you think?

33
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,990
[No]

34
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,950
It's not easy to deal with him.

35
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,270
How are things going on your side?

36
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,770
Of course.

37
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,860
Yes.

38
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,260
Yes.

39
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,750
Yes, Shuhe told me

40
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,500
he's been having a hard time finding a job lately.

41
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,490
Of course I'm worried.

42
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,780
Our son is back.

43
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,500
Son, you're back.

44
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,400
You could have just talked at home.

45
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,700
Why did you go out?

46
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,410

47
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,540

Tell him to do his best in the competition.

52
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,650
Our son asked you to do your best in the competition.

53
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,050
He said, "Got it. Thank you."

54
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,080
I'm going back to my room first.

55
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,580
Yes.

56
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,890
Of course I'm worried.

57
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,300
[I'm worried. He studied so hard in college.]

58
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:21,579
He studied so hard

59
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,620
in college.

60
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,000
His teachers also thought he did very well.

61
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,990
He even got a certificate.

62
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,180
But what happened?

63
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,240
After graduation,

64
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,070
who would have thought he can't find a job because he's deaf?

65
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,870
[He can't find a job because he's deaf]

66
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,870
[His teachers praised him and said he's great. He even got a certificate.]

67
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,920
Alright, Honey, I have to go.

68
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,840
I'm going to make dinner.

69

Sure.

Let me eat first.

74
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,830
Did you have to sound so suggestive?

75
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,940
Was I?

76
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,390
I just got up.

77
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,750
If you don't satisfy my appetite,

78
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,900
how am I supposed to satisfy your inhumane appetite for work?

79
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,360
Hard-working people won't starve to death.

80
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,659
But most of them will get sick and die first.

82
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,040
I won't look handsome if I lose any more weight.

[Are you gangsters?]

As long as we can get what we want,

00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,760
does it matter whether we are gangsters or not?

86
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,890
Little Boss.

87
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,720
We're not gangsters.

This is the living room.

00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,730
There's a public toilet on the right.

97
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,820
The laundry room is next to the kitchen.

98
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,050
The second floor is just as I described before.

99

This is Little Boss's room.

100

Your room is on the second floor.

101

When I'm away, keep a close eye on him.

102

If he does anything strange,

103
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,020
tell me immediately.

104
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:13,480
[He's my boss]

105
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,490
I'm the one paying your salary.

106
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,710
I'm easy to get along with.

107
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,570
Just remember one thing.

108
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,720
Don't enter my room

109
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,080
without my permission,

110
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,190
not even to wake me up.

111
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,669
You can call me or knock.

112
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,669
Just don't enter my room without my permission.

113

[I need your health report and food preferences]

114
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,070
No problem. Take care of me from now on.

115
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:33,470
You suddenly found a job and you moved to your boss's house.

116
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,980
And you have to keep the place of residence confidential.

117
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,230
Of course your dad is worried.

118
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,590
I'm leading my team to participate in a competition, so I'm not home.

119
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,890
Of course I'm worried.

120
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,430
How is the person you take care of?

121
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,780
He's afraid of hunger.

122
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
His personality is a bit eccentric.

123
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,790
But I'm paid a huge salary.

124
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,490
The content of the contract is reasonable too.

125
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,310
Dad, don't worry.

126
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,980
That's good. If you're not used to it, just come home.

127
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,840
Come home.

128
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,130
You can find another job.

129
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,340
Don't make yourself wronged.

130
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,340
Now, the whole family pays much attention

131
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,430
to your performance in Taiwan.

132
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,280
Dad, I don't want to...

133
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,800
You have to succeed!

134
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,100
If you fail, don't come back to me.

135
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:28,780
Okay.

136
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,510
But

137
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,090
doesn't coming home at the slightest setback suggest a lack of resilience?

138
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,450
You're right.

139
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,160
Then come back after you

140
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,760
make him suffer.

141
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,300
Do as your father said.

142
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,390
It's rare that he's so scheming.

143
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,400
I know.

144
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,410
Dad taught me

145
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,920
I can't let him feel comfortable if I feel upset.

146
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,710
But you also need to cook three meals.

147
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,530
Do you need me to cook the meals for you

148
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,720
and have them delivered?

149
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,700
I have to keep the address confidential.

150
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,790
You taught me how to cook.

151
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,140
Have faith in me.

152
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,050
Look, your son

153
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,260
is better than you.

154
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,440
Mind your words.

155
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,510
Did you mean our son's cooking is better than mine?

156
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:23,710
No.

157
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,840
That's not what I meant.

158
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,810
Honey, I...

159
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,820
Honey.

160
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,370
Honey.

161
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:50,810
I suddenly want some fruit juice.

162
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,490
What do you think?

163
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,350
The person I chose is not bad, right?

164
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,130
My meals have improved a lot in quality these days.

165
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,370
Everything is freshly made as ordered.

166
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,360
He gives me

167
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,350
whatever I want.

168
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,440
Not bad, indeed.

169
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,660
This should be one of the few right decisions you've made.

170
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,460
Little Boss.

171
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,160
Little Boss!

172
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,560
Jiang Shaopeng, what did you do?

173
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,240
Little Boss!

174
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,450
Yang Zixiang!

175
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,180
How is he?

176
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,270
Yang Zixiang!

[Personal Medical History: select the diseases you have had]

179
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,090
The doctor said you did a good job.

180
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,010
[It's my duty. What's the reason?]

181
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,870
He's allergic to kiwifruit.

182
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,200
How useless is he?

183
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,460
He doesn't even know what he's allergic to.

184
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,830
Is he going to expose me?

185
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,240
I'm going to check with the doctor to see

186
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,170
if he's allergic to anything else.

187
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,220
I don't like my little boss,

188
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,390
but...

189
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,040
thank you for saving him timely.

190
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,820
You're not bad.

191
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,680
Thank you.

192
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,440
[Feigning sleep may provide a temporary escape, but you can't run away forever]

193
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,160
Seize the moment.

194
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,870
Every moment is eternity.

195
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,040
I'll go with Song Shuhe to Kaohsiung tomorrow

196
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,830
to see the land.

197
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,230
You can just rest at home.

198
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,820
So...

199
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,060
Yang Zixiang.

200
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,670
Few people in Taiwan know who I am anyway.

201
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,850
You can pretend to be Yang Zixiang.

202
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,530
Let's just

203
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,700
keep it a secret.

204
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,360
Shuhe will do the same.

205
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,910
Everybody wins.

206
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,670
What other options are there?

207
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,380
I'll go on a business trip tomorrow.

208
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,490
I'll come back at night.

209
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,690
I'll leave him to you.

210

[You purposely drank Cheng Fengjie's fruit juice]

211
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,700
How could I possibly do that?

212
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,340
Severe allergies can be fatal.

213
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,900
Even if I wanted to fake illness to skip work,

214
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,160
I would never risk my life.

215
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,750
I don't have the courage.

216
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:01,660
[Really?]

217
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,680
Of course.

218
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,690
Just do your job.

219
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,810
Take

220
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,000
what you deserve.

221
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,990
Stay out of other things.

222
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:32,320
Since we failed last time, Yang Zixiang has hidden.

223
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,160
Hongcheng also keeps it a secret.

224
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,120
I'll send someone to investigate.

225
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,190
Yes.

226
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,140
I'll take care of it.

227
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,470
I shouldn't have agreed if I had known it's so difficult.

228

Qing.

Find Yang Zixiang and take care of him.

231
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,640
Destroy the collaboration between the two companies.

232
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,700
Once it's done,

233
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:09,569
I'll forget the money you owe me.

234
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,900
I'll also make you a branch leader.

[The alarm system is connected, with 24-hour video monitoring in operation]

He can take charge of a branch if he kills Yang Zixiang?

237
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,390
Who is Yang Zixiang?

238
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,680
Brother Dong has invested so much in order to get rid of him.

Xinjia.

240

Shut up.

241
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,819
Brother Dong will kill me if he finds out I was eavesdropping.

242
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:29,020
You eavesdropped...

243
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,540
Yes.

244
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,620
What did you hear this time?

245
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,830
A chance to prove myself.

246
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,550
If I can succeed, I can become a branch leader.

247

I'll leave everything here to you.

248

Be good.

How can I be bad since I'm sitting in a wheelchair?

Have a safe trip.

Sorry! Sorry!

Take your time.

It's okay if you want to take a shower.

There will be more after 9 p.m.

Quantity is not the point.

The point is whether I like them or not.

This is on me.

Even if the development project is successful,

it'll have nothing to do with me.
