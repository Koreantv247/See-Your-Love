00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,040
we've become so worried about each other's feelings

174
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:18,520
that we didn't dare to sit down and talk things through.

175
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,430
In the end,

176
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,330
in order to reassure us, our son

177
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,450
wouldn't tell us even when he was wronged outside.

178
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,820
You care about my feelings,

179
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,590
so you played along with my silly antics

180
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,760
and joked around.

181
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,560
You kept your feelings hidden inside

182
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,270
and never expressed yourself.

183
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,330
And your words became fewer and fewer.

184
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,180
I've never been someone who talks much.

185
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,830
Why are you saying this now?

186
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,920
Mom, don't think too much.

187
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,410
I'm sorry.

188
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,950
You lost your hearing because of me.

189
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,440
That's why I've been strict with you since your childhood,

190
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,660
insisting that you should learn sign language

191
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,760
and lip reading.

192
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,700
I even tried hard to raise money

193
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,070
to send you abroad to learn how to speak.

194
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,290
I focused so much on what I expected from you.

195
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,700
I didn't tell you

196
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,500
why I did that.

197
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,490
I asked you to learn so much

198
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,390
because I hoped your future life could be easier

199
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,100
and you wouldn't encounter so many difficulties.

200
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,690
But I never meant for you to pretend that you could hear,

201
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,620
just to reassure your father and me.

202
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,610
I thought

203
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,210
you wanted me...

204
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,420
to be normal.

205
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,700
What's not normal with you?

206
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,900
Who said you're not normal?

207
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:26,450
I thought...

208
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,940
What does "normal" mean?

209
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,320
I just hope you can accept yourself

210
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,730
and be strong enough.

211
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,240
But you shouldn't act tough.

212
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,570
Just say it when

213
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,450
you're tired or sad.

214
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,480
It's okay to be tired

215
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,910
or angry.

216
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,950
You can act cute in front of me.

217
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,770
You can rely on your dad.

218
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,010
You can get mad at us.

219
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,970
Son, you've done well enough.

220
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,600
We... We don't need you to be sensible for us.

221
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,810
We need you to be happy for yourself.

222
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,020
I'm sorry.

223
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,350
Stop apologizing to me.

224
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,580
We're family.

225
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,030
Don't be sorry.

226
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,830
It's fine as long as we speak openly.

227
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,210
You know what?

228
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,020
Although you pretended to be a dead person or a ghost

229
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,650
every day,

230
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,560
I liked it.

231
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:33,230
Every day after work,

232
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,020
I'd wonder if you'd come up with a new idea.

233
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,960
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?

234
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,380
Ignore your father.

235
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:43,910
Come.

236
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,950
Let me hug you.

237
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,650
Don't cry.

238
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,280
The food you brought is so delicious.

239
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,140
Right?

240
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,780
I wanted to have midnight snacks with my fiancé.

241
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,120
I waited for you all night, but you never returned.

242
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,210
You know clearly someone out there wants to kill you,

243
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,690
yet you still have the guts to go out.

244
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,810
Do you want to die?

245
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,290
I'm fine, right?

246
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:55,720
Of course.

247
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,260
If I hadn't asked Jonathan to pick you up,

248
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,950
do you think you could come back unscathed?

249
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,090
Pick me up?

250
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,100
She knew my whereabouts?

251
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:09,540
You have a fiancée but you said you like me.

252
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:11,340
You looked for Jiang Shaopeng?

253
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,790
This is between us.

254
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,170
Leave him alone.

255
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,130
The deaf can do everything except hearing.

256
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,440
Only a fool would work so hard.

257
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,250
I've packed spare clothes

258
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,430
for Auntie.

259
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,690
Where are the things she wants?

260
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:22,290
Then...

261
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,860
let's go back to the hospital.

262
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,240
I've never seen this coat before.

263
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,530
Whose coat is it?

264
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,950
Yang Zixiang left it in the hospital.

265
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,330
I brought it home when I came back last time.

266
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,700
I'll meet him today.

267
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,710
I'll help you give it to him.

268
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,030
I'll give it to him myself.

269
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,670
I'm going first.

270
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:51,250
Okay.

271
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,330
Ms. Zheng.

272
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,090
I thought you came

273
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,560
to help your fiancé.

274
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,650
My supervision is the best help.

275
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,270
You need to work even at this hour?

276
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,240
Thank you for your hard work.

277
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,310
What do you think?

278
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,990
I estimate the base bid amount for this tender to be around 20 billion NT dollars,

279
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,950
with a variation of no more than 30 million NT dollars.

280
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,940
But we still need to assess the prices from other vendors.

281
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,270
This tender selects the most advantageous bid,

282
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,570
making it difficult to predict.

283
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,600
Then...

284
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,720
figure something out.

285
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,090
I'm counting on you.

286
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:50,910
Good luck.

287
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,440
He is very useless and very smart.

288
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,730
That's too extreme.

289
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,610
I kind of miss the way he used to be.

290
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,530
People in love are really different.

291
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,510
Shaopeng's pen.

292
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,480
[Jiang Shaopeng]

293
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,420
It's mine.

294
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,870
I'll give it to him myself.

295
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,700
Dear Sean.

296
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,110
I want coffee.

297
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,880
Who are you doing this for?

298
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,240
Jiang Shaopeng?

299
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,690
He's not here.

300
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,110
No matter how hard you work, he can't see it.

301
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,420
You grew up in the same environment as me.

302
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,310
We face the same problem.

303
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,870
I thought we could be friends forever.

304
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:16,540
Has it never occurred to you that I would fall in love with you?

305
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,050
What do you think?

306
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,540
It was quite a diversion, right?

307
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,930
You'd rather work outside

308
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,470
and save money to rent a house

309
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,770
than go home?

310
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,910
Sit down.
