[Episode 4]

3
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,360
My phone...

4
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,240
This is it.

5
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,090
Jiang Shaopeng!

6
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,630
Jiang Shaopeng!

7
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,630
Jiang Shaopeng!

8
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,560
Jiang Shaopeng!

9
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,370
I tried to sneak away because he can't hear me.

10
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,800
Now,

11
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,210
it's my own fault.

12
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,850
All this time,

13
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,210
those who approached me

14
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:46,790
and those who sought me out

15
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,480
had their own agendas.

16
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,140
Only success is allowed!

17
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,360
If you fail,

18
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,640
don't come back to see me.

19
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,370
I...

20
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,380
Yes.

21
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,230
If you can't take over,

22
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,390
don't give those old men any hope,

23
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,280
especially your dad.

24
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,520
Brother, I...

25
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,680
Everyone is the same.

26
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,950
After saying what they want, they leave.

27
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,370
What I think doesn't matter to them.

28
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,660
No one cares about me,

29
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,380
and no one wants to be close to me,

30
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,550
just because

31
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,240
I am who I am.

32
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,420
If there's even one person,

33
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,130
just one,

34
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:45,490
I'd try to believe that

35
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,130
someone cares about me and loves me.

36
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,800
If there's just one,

37
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,460
I'd also try to believe in them

38
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,140
and reciprocate their care and efforts.

♫At that moment, names aren't needed♫

Don't open the door.

70
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,560
I can go in by myself.

71
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:50,990
A shower?

72
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,120
I can handle it.

73
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:28,940
Get out!

74
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,050
Don't come in!

75
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,860
Get out!

76
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,490
Don't come in!

77
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:48,940
It's okay.

78
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,690
I'm fine.

79
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,419
I'm scared of the pain.

80
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,650
Don't you have any transparent band-aids?

81
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,380
The kind that looks cool even after putting it on.

82
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:06,990
He can't hear me.

83
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,920
How should I gesture?

84
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,550
Trans...

85
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,550
Parent...

86
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,020
Band-Aid.

87
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,580
You found me. It's impressive.

88
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,660
You...

89
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,080
Found...

90
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,700
Me...

91
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,410
Looking good, right? I drew it myself.

92
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,880
Be gentle!

93
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,110
Be gentle!

94
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,140
I'm really scared of the pain.

95
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,020
Hey, no need to do that.

96
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,540
I'm not a kid.

97
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,950
Jiang Shaopeng.

98
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,210
Thank you.

99
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,220
Thank you.

100
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,970
Paying for information

101
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,330
is definitely worth it—

102
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,560
found you!

103
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,060
Yang Zixiang.

104
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,180
You've never killed anyone.

105
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,650
You sure you want to go?

106
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,460
I'll risk it.

107
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,080
I'll show the boss that I'm a real talent.

108
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,880
Come on.

109
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,890
You couldn't even kill a cockroach.

110
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,820
But you think you can kill someone?

111
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,370
Why can't I?

112
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,190
I was just showing mercy.

113
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,970
How can I bully the weak?

114
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,670
Can I buy you a drink, handsome?

115
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,650
Next time.

116
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,210
I'm just thirsty.

117
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,660
I'm not scared.

118
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,610
I'm just thirsty.

119
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,910
Want to Netflix and chill?

120
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:21,610
Go away.

121
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,050
He's mine.

122
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,460
Don't pester him.

123
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,070
He...

124
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,520
Yang Zixiang.

125
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,070
He's mine.

126
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,230
Mine.

127
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,610
Really?

128
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,460
Mine.

129
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,090
I won.

130
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,220
You are mine.

131
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,430
Mine.

132
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,600
You want me?

133
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,830
Who are you?

134
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,740
Yes, yes.

135
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:11,870
I want you.

136
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,090
Only I can kill...

137
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,760
What are we waiting for?

138
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,070
Come on.

139
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,620
I should be quick.

140
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,590
I can't get caught.

141
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,510
There are too many people here.

142
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,970
We shouldn't wait.

143
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,290
Put today's bill on my tab.

144
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,790
-Okay.
-Pay...

145
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,170
When are you coming home?

146
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,470
I don't know.

147
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:45,430
I forgot to ask about the break

148
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,070
when discussing my salary.

149
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,530
How could you forget something so important?

150
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,560
Even if you don't have weekends off,

151
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,670
at least you should have one day off a week.

152
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,070
So, you can come home and let me check on you.

153
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,720
Dad isn't home.

154
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,180
You're feeling lonely, right?

155
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,580
Who?

156
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,990
Who feels lonely?

157
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,490
Remember

158
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,470
to ask about your time off;

159
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,050
it's an employee benefit.

160
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,100
Things have been a bit tough lately.

161
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,700
He got injured tonight.

162
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,660
Injured?

163
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,650
Did he get hurt because of

164
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,220
your negligence?

165
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:21,070
No.

166
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,690
He went out tonight...

167
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,690
[Keep an eye on him when I leave for work]

168
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,400
[If he does anything strange, tell me immediately]

169
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,860
[Anything else is none of your business]

170
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,569
Morning.

171
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,760
I...

172
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,040
You...

173
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,869
Is this your first time?

174
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,150
No wonder...

175
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,520
you were so rough;

176
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,360
it made me uncomfortable.

177
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,730
You're uncomfortable?

178
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,920
I caused it?

179
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,560
You did.

180
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,770
I told you not to,

181
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,060
but you insisted.

182
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,410
Did I really do anything to you?

183
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,640
I thought you were good at this.

184
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,460
Guess I was wrong.

185
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,040
What did I do?

186
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,690
I slept with him?

187
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,290
How could I sleep with him?

188
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:23,990
Where's the knife?

189
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,630
[Xin]

190
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,770
Have you had breakfast?

191
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,630
[You asked me to be your caregiver because I can't hear, right?]

192
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,000
[I can't hear or speak, so I don't understand what you're saying]

193
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,610
I need a caretaker.

194
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,790
You're worried the person hired would be a leaker.

195
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,340
He's deaf.

196
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,080
It's perfect.

197
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,850
I want him.

198
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,880
What nonsense are you talking about?

199
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,750
[Cheng Fengjie told me to watch you, especially when he's not around]

200
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:52,970
[I can't hear, so you can leave home easily]

201
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,750
Jiang Shaopeng, I...

202
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,570
Jiang Shaopeng!

203
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,160
I have something to tell you.

204
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,040
Which gang?

205
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,210
Who sent him?

206
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,500
How did you get hurt?

207
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,270
I accidentally bumped into something.

208
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,500
Answer my question.

209
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,850
He didn't tell me.

210
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,870
I thought you knew best.

211
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,860
Who have you offended?

212
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,190
How would I know?

213
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,320
Everyone loves me;

214
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,070
there's no way someone wants to kill me.

215
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,900
Be serious.

216
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,330
Who did you offend?

217
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,110
Why can't you be the target?

218
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,220
You're more likely to offend people than I am.

219
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,620
The person was looking for you

220
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,860
and mistook me for you.

221
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,120
I told you. You look more like the boss than I do.

222
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,300
Could it be

223
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,490
Yang Zicheng?

224
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,470
Without you, the marriage alliance with the Zheng family...

225
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,880
My brother wouldn't!

226
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:14,690
Don't say anything

227
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,550
to ruin my relationship with him.

228
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,010
He's very nice to me.

229
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,890
When did his leg recover?

230
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,830
Jiang Shaopeng.

231
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,180
About yesterday...

232
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,670
[Resignation]

233
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,820
[Resignation]

234
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,630
Come back and take care of me.

235
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,380
Please. Please.
